The Monstergirls have come to join your colony.

They are:
The cowgirls, who make nice milk.
The foxgirls, who are sneaky.
The pack animals, centaurs and dryads.
The black harpies and red harpies, who produce beautful plumage.
The ice fairies and forest fairies, who produce weird dust.
The slimegirls, who make red potions.
The strange creature, the Impmother.
The thrumbogirls and the dragongirls, who are strong fighters.

All are advanced intelligence except slimegirls. They are good to keep as pets.
